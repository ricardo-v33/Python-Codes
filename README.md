# Python-Codes
Python codes created with Spyder for undergraduate research projects. Programs regarding tholins plot the preliminary results of Young's Modulus and Hardness values of tholin samples from NASA Ames Research Center and John Hopkins University and are compared to literature values. These are measurements from indentation and are shown with different nitrogen-methane mixing ratios. The Salt/Glycine codes are programs plotting the Young's Modulus and Hardness values of Salt/Glycine samples made at different concentrations and dried by either a hot plate or overnight in an oven.
