# Python-Codes
Python codes created with Spyder for undergraduate research projects. Programs regarding tholins plot the preliminary results of Young's Modulus and hardness values of Titan haze analog simulation, or tholin, samples from NASA Ames Research Center and John Hopkins University and are compared to literature values. These are measurements from nanoindentation and are shown for different nitrogen-methane mixing ratios. The Salt/Glycine codes are programs plotting the Young's Modulus and hardness values of Salt/Glycine samples made at different concentrations and dried by either a hot plate or overnight in an oven. Plots titled '1:6:2025' were implemented in my 2025 Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Abstract submission: A Cross-Laboratory Comparison of Titan Haze Analogs: Mechanical Properties. They display the preliminary results for the Young's modulus (GPa) and hardness (GPa) 5% CH4/N2 NASA ARC and JHU plasma tholins and are compared to Yu et al. 2018/2017. The substrates of each sample is also included for comparison and efforts to answer the question of substrate choice influencing the mechanical properties of tholins.
